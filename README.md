# Asset Booking Web Application

This Django project demonstrates a small asset booking system.  
It features three data models:

- **Asset** – equipment that can be booked
- **Booking** – records of who booked an asset and when
- **UserMessage** – simple contact messages

Two user roles exist:

- **Admin** users (``is_staff``) manage all records via the Django admin site and dedicated CRUD views.
- **Regular** users can register, log in, book assets and edit their own bookings.

Sample data for 10 records in each table can be generated by running:

```bash
python data.py
```

## Testing

Run the Django test suite with:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

## Agile Approach

The application was created iteratively.  Each sprint delivered a small piece of functionality—starting with user authentication, then asset management, followed by booking logic and user messaging.  Feedback after each iteration informed the next set of tasks, allowing requirements to evolve while always keeping a working application.
